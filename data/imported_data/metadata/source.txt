Lord of the Rings API import

- Created an account at https://the-one-api.dev/v2 in order to get an authentication token.

- Queried the https://the-one-api.dev/v2 to get all character information in the API.

- Read in the data as a json file and turned said json file into a tibble.
  #normally at this point we would just save this json file to the imported_data file, but had trouble getting the json file to be read in during cleaning so continued with next steps so we could export the data as a csv file.

- Unnested lists that made up the json file to rectangulate data and added a row to specify what series the data was from.

- Exported the data as a csv into the imported_data folder as lotr_raw.csv.
