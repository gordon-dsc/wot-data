Lord of the Rings Data Cleaning

 - Read in lotr_raw.csv from the imported_data folder created from import.qmd 
 
 - Selected columns name, height, race, gender, birth, death, hair and series from the data
 
 - Set blank cells' values to NA
 
 - In the birth and death column changed all ages (First Age, Second Age, Third Age, Fourth Age and Years of the Trees) to their shorthand (FA, SA, TA, FO, TY)
 
 - Extracted the numbers from the birth and death columns and placed them into the new birth_year and death_year columns and parsed these new columns as numbers
 
 - Extracted the shorthand ages from the birth and death columns and palced thme into the new birth_age and death_age columns
 
 - Created a function (calculate_age_lotr) to calculate how many years a character was alive for if the birth_year, death_year, birth_age, and death_age were given. The objects first_age, second_age, third_age and years_of_the_trees represent the amount of years in each age. Years in the years_of_the_tress must be multiplied by the yt_year_lenght to calculate the correct number of actual years(years of the trees years are longer than the years of other ages.) 
 
 - Created a new empty list called years_alive
 
 - Looped the lord of the rings data through calculate_age_lotr and dropped each value into years_alive list
 
 - Added the years_alive list as a new column the to the lord of the rings data
 
 - Created a new column simplified_hair by extracting the common hair colors from the cells in the hair column
 
 - Cleaned simplified_hair by capitalizing, removing extra white space and removing extra symbols
 
 - Mutated height column to change all instances of nine to 9, feet to ', removing all spaces and manually changing data that had no signifier
 
 - Extracted any height that was stored in the #feet'#inches" format and placed these values in to the height_simplified column
 
 - From the height_simplified column extracted the number of feet a character had and palced it into the height_simplified_ft column and extracted the number of inches a character had and placed it into the height_simplified_in column
 
 - Calculated the total number of inches each character was by combining the height_simplified_ft and height_simplified_in values to create height_in column
 
 - Tidied the Gender Column by changing mispelled or wierdly spelled data to match the rest
